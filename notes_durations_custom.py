#DURATIONS
# Durations of notes are listed and modified according to the following rules:

# 1. The lengths of slurs and rests are added to the lengths of previous notes
# 2. Repeated notes are written out, i.e. the lenghts are added where necessary

# Output:
# filename    lengths of notes
# file.xml 	 [0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.75, 0.25, 0.5, ...]
